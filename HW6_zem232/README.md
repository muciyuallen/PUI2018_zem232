Summary: Compared to naive mice that recieved methamphetamine (METH) doses for the first time, mice with adolescent exposure to METH showed a greater loss of tyrosine hydroxylase immonoreactivity in striatum, loss of THir fibers in the substantia nigra reticulata & decreased dopamin transpirter level. The results of this study indicate that adolescent binge exposure in adolescent mice causes chronic, adverse effects on and greater overall damage to the dopaminergi system than when mice use METH after adolescence.
